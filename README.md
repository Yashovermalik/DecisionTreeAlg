# DecisionTreeAlg

I took titanic dataset and taken some features through it and removed all other features .
Now target as Survived feature and Rest features are for x_label.
After removal and filling of null values and converting float to integer values.
Took the data and moved forward towards model selection and applied model to the dataset.
Then got a gud accuracy score or prediction score based on the model.
