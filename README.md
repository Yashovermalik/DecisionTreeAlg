# DecisionTreeAlg

I took titanic dataset and taken some features through it and removed all other features .
Now target as Survived feature and Rest features are for x_label.
After removal and filling of null values and converting float to integer values.
Then took the categorical data and with the help of Labelencoder converted them into binary values and here all the preprocesing of data got finished.
Took the data and moved forward towards model selection and applied model to the dataset.
Then got a gud accuracy score or prediction score based on the model.
